# Image-Segmentation-Using-Color-and-Texture-Descriptors-with-Expectation-Maximization
An algorithm for unsupervised segmentation of an RGB image.

Introduction :

Natural processes/systems are likely to follow gaussian distributions (or a combination of). Moreover, I have always been intrigued by unsupervised clustering methods due to the inherent statistical constraints that these methods try to capture from limited data to model the system.

Therefore, I have decided to take the approach of modelling the image data distribution as a Gaussian Mixture Model. By randomly sampling 1000 data points (pixels from the image) over 1000 iterations, we could estimate the parameters (means/labels, covariances and joint membership weights of a point belonging to each cluster). I have applied two forms of expectation maximization (initialization = kmeans & using dirichlet process prior) to derive optimum clusters and labels, with suitable hyperparameters and plot the distribution. Model building, training and testing was achieved using the Scikit-Learn API.

Example Duration for Train Step : 

Gaussian Mixture Done in 0.041s.<== ~in this range always
Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Done in 0.116s. <==~in this range always

Short Form Algorithm:

1.Load Image ->

2. Apply Gaussian Filter and Convert to CIELAB space as it better approximates human color perception ->

3. Capture texture information using Local Binary Patterns

4. Flatten Image (and  to prepare data -> 

5. Normalise and scale data -> 

6. Sample 1000 data points randomly and feed to estimator -> Run expectation and maximization step alternatively using these data points, using scikit GMM and DPGMM.

7. Fit model on entire Image

8. Grab output labels & assign each pixel a color corresponding to its membership class ->

9. Use a dictionary of BGR color codes to query pixel color based on labels. ->

Future Algorithm Extension:

1. Use geometric priors to constrain clustering and improve segmentation results. (Intuition = Closer Objects are More Similar in texture and color)

2. Optimise Code

Results :

1. Color Data Distribution ![alt text](images/ColorData_Distribution_GMMTop_DPGMMBottom.png)
2. Color + Texture Data Distribution ![alt text](images/JointTextureColorDistribution_GMMTop_DPGMMBottom.png )
3. Segmentation (Only Color) ![alt text](images/Results_OnlyColor.png")
4. Segmentation (Texture + Color) ![alt text](images/Results_JointTextureColor.png")

Conclusion:

Clearly, adding texture information enhances the segmentation results. Adding more carefully designed features that capture correlations among data samples well is highly recommended.
